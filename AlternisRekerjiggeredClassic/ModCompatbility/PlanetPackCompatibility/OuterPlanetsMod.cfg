			@description = Discovered at the same time as Plock, the square heads in charge of cataloguing the astronomical discoveries mixed up the records of two celestial bodies, leading to years of one being confused for the other. The surface of Vall is covered in white mountain ranges and blue basins, which could be the result of cryovolcanic activity. This might mean that the moons harbors a liquid ocean beneath its frozen crust.
