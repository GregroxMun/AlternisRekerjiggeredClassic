			description = Pol is a very unique object orbiting Jool. Its comparatively low density suggests that it is a rubble pile, a bundle of rocks that happen to be flying in the same orbit, held together by what is probably fair to say is only partly gravity. It was thought to be a distant planet like Eve or Tylo since antiquity because it was so small in the sky. It was only after someone tried to calculate the orbit of Pol around the sun that they realized it was really going around Jool this whole time. Its surface is a strange muddle of yellows, browns, all in a very confusing and mysterious unknown composition. No one has ever been able to figure out for certain what the darned surface is made of. Three separate studies returned totally different planet-wide surface compositions, ranging from stony to icy to organic composition. The only way to tell for sure what the darned surface is made from would be to retrieve a sample directly.

			%description = Snez is a small yellow moon orbiting Meander. It would seem to be the second member of a species of space-faring pollen of unknown source, perhaps from another dimension with huge flowers that span the size of thousands of Suns.
