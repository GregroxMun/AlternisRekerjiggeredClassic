			description = Bop is a small irregular moon of Jool. It is dark and brown, and because of that it took a long time to discover. Spectral analysis suggests that it is probably a carbon-rich captured asteroid that formed in the asteroid belt just beyond Tylo. In addition to being carbon-rich, it is also rich in ices and stone. When it was first recorded as a moon, the scientist in charge did not enter it in the record books because he was not sure if any object like Bop could possible be stable in such an orbit. He had to spend years of calculation before he managed to prove that, in fact, Bop could not possibly exist in the orbit he had observed. Around the same time, another astronomer managed to conclusively prove that Bop would definitely be stable. The problem arose because the former scientist was confusing Bop for a further out moon, Pol. That mistake would go unexplained for half a century.

			Daphy is a small brown asteroidal moon orbiting Meander. It is the most brown object in the Alternis system, and thus has been given the nickname "Themostbrownobjectinthealternissystem." However, since this nickname is a mouthful, its normal name Daphy is more common.
