			description = Minmus is a small moon orbiting Jool. It is red in color, and very close to our parent planet. It is within one of the hazardous radiation belts of Jool, and since it has no magnetic field of its own, it is one of the most irradiated places in the solar system. (Pack your dosimeter.) It is the most red-tinted natural object in the solar system, and its actual composition is something of a mystery. Some have argued the surface is a strange sort of ice, others have insisted that it must be an oxygen-rich mineral. One astronomer was quoted as jokingly suggesting that Minmus was made of a cinnamon candy.
