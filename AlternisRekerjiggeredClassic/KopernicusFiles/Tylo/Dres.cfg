			description = Dres is a medium sized moon orbiting Tylo. The moon is dark grey with a few spots dotting its lumpy surface. It was notorious among astronomy students and professors alike for being "The most boring thing in the entire sky." Indeed, the Kerbal Astronomical Union came to the same conclusion, and hastily reclassified the moon as a moonlet. Not much is known about its structure or composition because nobody really cares.
