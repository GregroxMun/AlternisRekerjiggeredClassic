			description = Moho is the closest planet to the Sun. It is unlikely to have an atmosphere, as any atmosphere would have long since been stripped away by the powerful solar wind. However, The planet's proximity to The Sun may give it active volcanoes to replenish an atmosphere. Some minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society have thought up ways to start active volcanism in the event that it does not already exist there. Such research has led to exciting new aerospace breakthroughs.
